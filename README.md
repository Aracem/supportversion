# Support Version
This library is for you if:
* You are lazy.
* You hate search how the f*** check the Android version every time you need it.
* You think that ```Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.SOMETHING``` it's a very ugly code to write here and there.

With SupportVersion you simple can do:

```
    if (SupportVersion.lollipop()) {
        //do awesome stuff
    }
```
